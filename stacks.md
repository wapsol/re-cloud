re-cloud provides out of the box **Stacks**, which are sets of application software (AppStacks), or systems software (SysStacks) that help organisations get up and running fast, depeding on your needs. 
You can of course mix and match AppStacks.
Likewise, some SysStacks are optional and some 

Stacks can be freely extended with packages of software applications that you would like to provide to your users.

This page documents the Stacks available at the current time with brief descriptions.

# AppStacks

## AI Stack

- Ollama, ChromaDB, neo4js (RAG stack)
- AutoML
- Scikit-Learn, NLTK
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tensorflow, Statsmodels

### Ollama

An LLM-inferencing server including AI Chat, and an API to query your private LLMs.

### ChromaDB

A vector-database for your RAG and fine-tuning projects.

## Office Stack

### NextCloud

A cloud based file-server that allows company users to maintain a common repository. 
Files are then available on browser, desktop file managers and iOS and Android module apps.

### Only Office

A office suite that runs completely on your private cloud. 
Think of this as Google Docs on your private cloud with all data and files stored locally.

## IoT and Industy 4.0 Stack

### Eclipse Kapua

Eclipse Kapuaâ„¢ is a modular integration platform for IoT devices and smart sensors that aims at bridging Operation Technology with Information Technology.

### Eclipse Kura

A gateway-level intermediatory edge framework between your IoT devices and central Kapua.

Eclipse Kura is an edge framework designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of IoT applications. It provides a robust and flexible environment for building IoT solutions that require edge computing capabilities, device management, and seamless cloud integration.

## SaaS and Software Development

- React.js
- Python, PHP and Ruby

## Data Engineering Stack

- Cloudquery

## Enterprise Stack

- MailPiler (Email-Archiving)

# SysStacks

### Site VPN

You can optionally provide VPN termination to your cloud in various scenarios. For example, all office/site users can access your SPC resources, applications running on them, files and objects etc. etc. over a solidly secure tunnel.

Similarly, companies with IoT networks in the field, can terminate their IoT gateway connections on SPC on VPN tunnels.

re-cloud makes it fast, easy and simple to create VPN endpoints and start tunnelling users, gateways and devices.

### KALI

- This SysStack is available from Horizon > Glacier for purposes of managing cloud security. 
- It provides a set of penetration tests, an onboard intrusion detection system and control mechanisms for application security.
