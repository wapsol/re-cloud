### What is re-cloud?

re-cloud is a software package that enables to spin up a private cloud on your own bare-metal hardware within minutes. We call bare metal hardware "**nodes**".
You will need at least 3 nodes with the following minimum configuration to get re-cloud initially set up. After that, you can add nodes as your needs scale.

- 8 core CPU
- 64 GB RAM
- 1 TiB SSD

### What can you do with re-cloud?

Depending on the type of organisation you are, you can use your private cloud for specific functions.
To support you as much as possible out of the box, we provide "**Stacks**" of software applications, to help you get productive with your cloud fast, in the best cases within an hour or two.

We support following Stacks:

- AI Stack
- Office Stack
- IoT Stack
- SaaS and Software

Stacks are installed on your private-cloud as Docker containers, either on VMs on your private-cloud, or the optional Kubernetes cluster running on it.
